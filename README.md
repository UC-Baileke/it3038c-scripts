# My Github repo for IT3038C

### Project 2

For project 2 I decided to do an extension of Project 1 and just add on an additional task that was offered from project 1.

My original project one had a python script importing datetime information and outputing the time on the requested machine.

This time I also have the project running a python script to import the disk utility function to output the total space, used space and free space available on the device harddrive.

the code added for this project is an import of the disk utility "shutil" and the printed outputs for Total, Used and Free.

#Example code for this lab was referenced from the project description via https://phoenixnap.com/kb/get-current-date-time-python for info from project 1 and via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48929553/get-hard-disk-size-in-python for info from project 2.
