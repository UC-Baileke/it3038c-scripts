# My Github repo for IT3038C

### Project 3

For project 3 I decided to do an extension of Project 1 and Project 2 with a continuation of having the project pull and report additional data for the users convience.

My original project one had a python script importing datetime information and outputing the time on the requested machine.

The addition from project 2 allowed the script to import the disk utility function to output the total space, used space and free space available on the device harddrive.

Then from project 3 the script imported tracemalloc to collect data for memory usage.

the code added for this project is an import of "datetime", "shutil" and "tracemalloc"  the printed outputs are Total, Used and Free Disk space, the date time and the current and peak memory usage during the scripts runtime.

#Example code for this lab was referenced from the project description via https://phoenixnap.com/kb/get-current-date-time-python for info from project 1 and via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48929553/get-hard-disk-size-in-python for info from project 2. Additionally I found additional info for this project towards part 3 from https://medium.com/survata-engineering-blog/monitoring-memory-usage-of-a-running-python-program-49f027e3d1ba
